    <h2>The Sun's Nearest Star</h2>
      <p>Although not visible to the eye, Proxima Centauri is
      the closest known star to our sun, (only) 4.22 light years
      away! We cannot see Proxima Centauri because it is what 
      astonomers call a "red dwarf star;" compared to other stars
      it is cold and very dim.</p>

    <h2>Proxima Isn't Alone</h2>
      <p>Proxima Centauri is a part of the Alpha Centauri star system,
      three stars that are caught within eachother's gravitational
      field, with Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. It's
      membership in the star system is not certain, as it is one fifth
      of a light year away from the other two stars.</p>

    <h2>Proxima B</h2>
      <p>Astronomers have recently discovered the planet Proxima B
      rotating Proxima Centauri within the habitable zone of
      Proxima Centauri, meaning that liquid water could exist on
      the surface. But, it was discovered that Proxima B does not
      have an Earth-like atmosphere, so there is likely no life.</p>
